# tamagotchi-javascript
Little game made with Javascript


I developped a social tamagotchi during the confinement with only JavaScript.
It could be a good stater boilerplate for a futur JS project, with useful design pattern code base.
Check the files into the project, and be inspired by the code architecture for your next project. :)
